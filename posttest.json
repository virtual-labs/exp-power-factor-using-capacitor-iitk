      "question": "The power factor angle of a purely inductive circuit is: ?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "45 degrees",
        "b": "60 degrees",
        "c": "75 degrees",
        "d": "90 degrees"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect because in a purely inductive circuit, the phase angle cannot be 45 degrees. This would occur in circuits with both resistive and inductive components.",
        "b": "Incorrect, as the phase angle in a purely inductive circuit is not 60 degrees.",
        "c": "Incorrect because 75 degrees is not the phase angle for a purely inductive circuit.",
        "d": "Correct. In a pure inductive circuit, the current lags the voltage by 90 degrees. The power factor is the cosine of this angle. Cos(90) = 0, so the power factor is zero."

      "question": "The power factor of capacitive circuits is:? ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Leading",
        "b": "Lagging",
        "c": "Both of these",
        "d": "Any of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Capacitive circuits have a leading power factor because the current leads the voltage.",
        "b": "Incorrect, as lagging power factors are associated with inductive circuits, not capacitive circuits.",
        "c": "Incorrect, as the power factor of capacitive circuits is always leading.",
        "d": "Incorrect, as the power factor of capacitive circuits cannot be arbitrary; it is always leading."

      "question": "What is the effect of a low power factor on an electrical system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increased energy losses",
        "b": "Improved voltage regulation",
        "c": "Reduced current flow",
        "d": "No effect"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. A low power factor increases the current required for the same amount of useful power, leading to higher energy losses due to increased resistance in the system.",
        "b": "Incorrect, as a low power factor worsens voltage regulation, not improves it.",
        "c": "Incorrect because a low power factor increases, not reduces, the current flow in the system.",
        "d": "Incorrect, as a low power factor has a significant impact on the efficiency and performance of an electrical system."

      "question": "Which of the following components can improve the power factor of an inductive load?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Resistor",
        "b": "Inductor",
        "c": "Capacitor",
        "d": "Transformer"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect, as a resistor cannot improve the power factor of an inductive load.",
        "b": "Incorrect, as an inductor worsens the power factor by increasing the lagging reactive power.",
        "c": "Correct. A capacitor can counteract the lagging current caused by an inductive load, improving the power factor.",
        "d": "Incorrect, as a transformer does not improve the power factor. It only transfers power."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",

    {
      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the apparent power (S) in an AC circuit?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "S = P + jQ",
        "b": "S = P / PF",
        "c": "S = V × I",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. S = P + jQ is the formula for apparent power in rectangular form, where P is the real power and Q is the reactive power.",
        "b": "Correct. S = P / PF relates apparent power (S) to real power (P) and power factor (PF).",
        "c": "Correct. S = V × I is the formula for apparent power in terms of voltage (V) and current (I).",
        "d": "Correct. All the formulas listed define the relationships involving apparent power in different forms."
