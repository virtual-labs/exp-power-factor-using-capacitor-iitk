 
<h4>Procedure:</h4><br>
<p>
The circuit is already built in the simulation. Follow the steps below to perform the experiment:<br><br>

1. **Complete the circuit by clicking on the ON button given in the circuit.**<br>
2. Adjust the **resistor value** using the given slider and click the **Add Table** button to store the data in the table.<br>
3. Observe the initial values of **current, voltage, and power** before adding the capacitor.<br>
4. There are **two red buttons** near the capacitor: <br>
   - **Right button:** Connects the capacitor in parallel with the load.<br>
   - **Left button:** Removes the capacitor from the circuit.<br>
5. Click the **Right button** to add the capacitor to the circuit.<br>
6. Once the capacitor is added, observe the new readings of **current, voltage, and power**.<br>
7. Click the **Add Table** button again to store the new data in the table.<br>
8. Compare the **power factor** before and after adding the capacitor to analyze the improvement.<br>
9. Use the **Left button** to remove the capacitor and repeat the steps if needed.<br>
