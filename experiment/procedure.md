 
<h4>Procedure:</h4><br>
<p>The components are given at the right side on the simulator. They can be dragged and the circuit can be formed as in the circuit diagram. The colour change in the nodes of the components confirms the connection. By noting the current and voltage , power and power factor can be calculated further the improvement can be made using capacitor. Hence the experiment can be verified. </p>
