        "c": "The power factor is unity when the circuit is purely resistive. The maximum value of the power factor is unity (1). The power factor for a purely resistive load is unity (1). The power factor for RL load is less than unity (1) and is lagging in nature. The power factor for RC load is also less than unity (1) but leading in nature.",
