<h2>Power Factor: </h2> <br>
<p>
Power factor is an important parameter for the calculation of active and reactive power in electrical circuit. It has significance only for AC circuit. For DC circuit, it is not considered for power calculation. Its value is unity for DC circuit and may vary in between zero to one for AC circuit

  Power Factor Formula : cosɸ <br>
 
Formula use to find  Actual Power and Calculated Power: <br>
For calculating  actual power we needed to calculate Multiplying Factor<br> 
 
Multiplying  Factor  (M.F) = Voltage range  x  current range  x  rated power factor  x  Half scale Deflection.( can be find from wattmeter) <br>
 
Actual Power =  W x M.F. <br>
 
Now to find Calculated Power: <br>
P  =  V x I  x cosɸ <br>
 
Value of Actual power should be same as Calculated Power. <br>
